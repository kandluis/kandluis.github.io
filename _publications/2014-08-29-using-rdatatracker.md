RDataTracker is a library of R functions that collects data provenance in the form of a Data Derivation Graph (DDG) when executing an R script or working in the R console. The DDG is saved as a text file (ddg. txt) in a special DDG directory, where it can be viewed, stored, and queried using a separate tool, DDG Explorer.
