Hi all, and welcome to my home on the web! I'm Luis, a Staff Software Engineer at [Meta AI](https://ai.facebook.com/) (formerly known as Facebook), [reeingineering Meta AI's deep learning platforms](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/reengineering-facebook-ais-deep-learning-platforms-for-interoperability/). I'm also a guest lecturer at [North Carolina A&T University](https://www.ncat.edu/) teaching [Algorithm Foundations for AI and Cybersecurity](https://www.comp285.ml/). I previously worked on graph neural networks at [DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com), advancing the state-of-the-art in [traffic prediction](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/traffic-prediction-with-advanced-graph-neural-networks) and learned the art of large-scale distributed systems at Google by building [Procella](https://research.google/pubs/pub48388/).

I spend my free time [doing research for fun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WdafpDsAAAAJ&hl=en).

I have a MS in Computer Science from [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/), advised by [Doug James](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~djames/) and working with [Jurij Leskovek](https://profiles.stanford.edu/jure-leskovec) and [Fei-Fei Li](https://profiles.stanford.edu/fei-fei-li). I specialized in artificial intelligence and CS theory - focusing on convulutional neural networks and sequence models for image and language understanding and graph neural networks for [geometric deep learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cxhvQK9ALQ). I also have a BA from [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) in computer science and mathematics.

I am the co-author of [The Effectiveness of Data Augmentation in Image Classification using Deep Learning
](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04621) and [ETA Predictions with Graph Neural Networks in Google Maps](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3459637.3481916). I worked to take my research to production, [substantially improving the travel-time predictions](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/traffic-prediction-with-advanced-graph-neural-networks) in [Google Maps](https://blog.google/products/maps/google-maps-101-how-ai-helps-predict-traffic-and-determine-routes/) (featured across several media outlets such as [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/03/covid-19-forced-google-maps-to-change-how-it-predicts-traffic.html), [Engaget](https://www.engadget.com/google-maps-deep-mind-ai-accuracy-140005698.html), [VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/2020/09/03/deepmind-claims-its-ai-improved-google-maps-travel-time-estimates-by-up-to-50/), [CNET](https://www.cnet.com/news/heres-how-google-maps-uses-ai-to-predict-traffic-and-calculate-routes/), the [Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21419632/how-google-maps-predicts-traffic-eta-ai-machine-learning-deepmind), and [ZDNet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-maps-and-deepmind-enhance-ai-capabilities-to-improve-route-calculations/)).
